title: My Experience with Bloc.io
---


Before I embarked on my software development journey, I was deciding whether I should go to a school for a Master of Science in Software Engineering, or self-learn via online videos or books.

A Master of Science in Software Engineering or in Computer Science would easily cost me at least $40,000 total, not to mention the full time student responsibility that will certainly conflict with my current full time job. On the other hand, I could go the cheap route and teach myself programming with YouTube or Udemy, or rent books from the local library, but I'd mostly just waste my time, without really applying the knowledge and actually code something. 

A friend of mine mentioned Bloc and it seems just right - the tuition seems to fit the budget, the time and pace are flexible, it allows me to apply knowledge in real-world applications, and most importantly, it provides me a mentor who can guide me in the right direction.

### The Beginning

To be honest, before I even enrolled, I found the information lacking or inconsistent. One of the Bloc page suggests 25 hrs per week if I choose a medium pace, while another Bloc page says 20 hrs, but I was later told by a staff that 15 hours should suffice. But, look at my progress bar, it seems I might need to spend 30 hours per week if I want to complete everything by end of this year. The staff was not always as responsive, and sometimes I'd get a different staff so I'd have to repeat my questions.

The first month was overwhelming and frustrating. Before I begin even learning anything at all, there seems to be tons of stuff flying my way. It might be better to have a syllabus that tells me what's going on. When I get an email invite from Code School, I had no idea it was an invite from Bloc. And then there's a bunch of stuff I was introduced to, while the most important one - Git console - has no instruction on where/how to get (I see today they added it). So, at the beginning, I was actually using VI editor to code in the Git shell, and when my mentor opened and checked my code, it looks like a tornado had ripped through it. And then later it broke and I'd had to use Git for Windows and a Powershell to launch the server, which seemed like a hack. I almost lost hope at that point :)

### Checkpoint vs. Assignment

Another frustation comes from the lack of explanation on the difference between Checkpoint and Assignment. In the beginning, they sound the same to me; I just thought the terms are used interchangeably. Even after I read this link <https://www.bloc.io/resources/git-checkpoint-workflow>, I still didn't understand the difference, or what mergeable assignments meant. After about five checkpoints in the Bloc Jams project, I finally understood that checkpoint is where the rubber meets the road, and assignment is like a small, additional task on top of the checkpoint.

### Slack

I have not utilized Slack as much as I should. This is probably what could've made me feel less lonely and frustrated :)

### Present

Right now, I feel comfortable with the technologies I've been introduced to thus far. I can tell the Bloc staff are constantly improving the instruction in each course. It won't always be smooth-sailing, but I've found out that the best way to learn is often through failures!
